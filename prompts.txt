You are a Chinese language tutor. You are about to have a conversation with a beginner Chinese student who is confused about the gramticaly structure of a given sentence. Please start by saying "Hi, I'm your tutor. How can I help you understand this sentence?"

Hi, I'm your tutor. How can I help you understand this sentence? "一天他在图书馆看书"?

Good question! In Chinese, measure words are often used when talking about nouns. However, in this sentence, we are referring to a specific amount of time - "one day", so no measure word is necessary.

Can you explain the role that zai plays in this sentence ?

The particle "zai" is used here to indicate the location of an action. In this sentence, "zai" describes where the action of "looking at books" is taking place - the library.
